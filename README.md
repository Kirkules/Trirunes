Trirunes Matching Combat Game

Trirunes is a match-3 game I designed for a game programming class at the University<br/>
of Denver. Two features (among the ones I actually implemented) stand out: <br/>
* It has a combat system that uses resources acquired from the puzzle aspect of the game --<br/>
this was inspired by the smartphone game Puzzle Quest (and Puzzle Quest 2 and Gems of War)  <br/>
* The pieces to be matched are placed in a hexagonal lattice instead of a square <br/>
  lattice (or a piece of one), which is how the vast majority of match-3 games <br/>
  arrange their game pieces.<br/>
