Trirunes Matching Combat Game

Trirunes is a match-3 game I designed for a game programming class at the University<br/>
of Denver. Two features (among the ones I actually implemented) stand out: first, it<br/>
has a combat system that uses resources acquired from the puzzle aspect of the game --<br/>
this was inspired by the smartphone game Puzzle Quest (and Puzzle Quest 2 and Gems of <br/>
War); the second feature is that the pieces to be matched are placed in a hexagonal<br/>
lattice instead of a square lattice (or a piece of one), which is how the vast<br/>
majority of match-3 games arrange their game pieces.<br/>
